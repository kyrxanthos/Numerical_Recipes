# Numerical_Recipes
Final year course in the University of Edinburgh on Numerical Recipes. Checkpoints were the main source of assesment in the course.

### Course material includes:

- Linear algebra (solving linear systems of equations, diagonalization)
- Minimisation methods
- Parameter fitting to data sets (Chi squared, maximum likelihood, Bayesian
inference)
- Random number generation
- Root finding
- Monte Carlo methods
- Integration
- Differential equations (ordinary and partial)
- Discrete Fourier Transform
- Principles of machine learning
